            </li>
            <li>
              Ensure the markings on your measuring device are clearly marked
              and can be seen by the judge. Consider marking the lines on your
              Hawg Trough with a black marker. However, excessive marking may
              result in a penalty.
            </li>
          </ol>

            </li>
            <li>
              Your LONGEST verified lengths will be your total score. Fish will
              be measured to the nearest ¼ inch and there will be no
              rounding-up, only down.
            </li>
            <li>Auto Culling will be enabled for all events.</li>
            <li>
              The angler with the highest total score will be declared the

              event.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h5>Judging</h5>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Challenger’s photos will be judged and scored by a panel
              designated by the Tournament Staff.

            <li>
              Photos that do not meet the requirements will not be counted.
              Measured length should be clearly visible. All fish will be scored
              by ¼” increments. If the fish is slightly under the nearest ¼” the
              measurement will be rounded down. For example, if a fish is 18 1/8
              inches the fish will be entered and scored as an 18-inch fish.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Tournament organizer and staff will be solely responsible and
              retain the right to declare any photos unacceptable.
            </li>
